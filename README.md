# CPS 251 - Android Programming

This is a selection of the homework problems for the Washtenaw Community College class [CPS 251 - Android Programming](https://catalog.wccnet.edu/current/courses/cps-251.php) which I took in Spring 2024.

"In this course, students create applications using Android Studio. These applications will run on Android devices. Students will use the latest Google-preferred programming language to develop these applications. Topics include graphical user interfaces, events, intents, view model, live data, database and other concepts for developing android applications."
